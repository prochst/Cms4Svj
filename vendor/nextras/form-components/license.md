Good news! You may use Nette Framework under the terms of either
the New BSD License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or 3.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is easy to understand and it
places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the framework. If the GPL
fits better to your project, you can use the framework under this license.

You don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You can freely
use Nette Framework in commercial projects as long as the copyright header
remains intact.

Please be advised that the name "Nette Framework" is a protected trademark and its
usage has some limitations. So please do not use word "Nette" in the name of your
project or top-level domain, and choose a name that stands on its own merits.
If your stuff is good, it will not take long to establish a reputation for yourselves.
